 * Dark is the declared default rather than "system": the Void ground is what

 * the brand is designed around. The toggle in the header gives full control,
 * and next-themes persists the choice.
 *
 * disableTransitionOnChange is deliberately off — the theme toggle's
 * cross-rotating icons are the switch's whole affordance, and that flag would
 * suppress them along with everything else.
